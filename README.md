# Learning Python
In this specific project I learn to program in Python. Here I add code and projects that I'm working on via Pirple.com and other resources. I've chosen to divide this project into separate branches so that I can keep track of specific things I'm learning: Variables, functions, If statements, lists, loops, classes and so forth.

List of Project Branches
1. Variables
2. Functions
3. "If" statements
4. Lists
5. Loops
6. Dictionairies and Sets
