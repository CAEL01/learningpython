# Learning Python
In this specific project I learn to program in Python. Here I add branches that I'm working on via Pirple.com and other learning resources I find here in GitHub. With these resources, I teach myself how to code in Python. I've chosen to divide this project into separate branches so that I can keep track of specific things I'm learning: Variables, functions, If statements, lists, loops, classes and so forth. I've linked each separate branch below for quick access. I believe that this makes it easier for you to follow my learning process up until I code my final project (which is really only the beginning of my Python journey).
